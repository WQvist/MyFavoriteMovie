# MyFavoriteMovie

Script for me to decide which one of all movies I've rated on IMDb is my top favorite.

The commented section reads ratings.csv into the database (ratings.csv can be downloaded from your IMDb account).
The script then fetches all movies in the table which are still unsorted, and takes two titles and let me decide between them. The unpreferred choice is marked as 'sorted'. 
Next choice is between my previous preference and a new title.

My first usage of SQL and database handling in general.
