# MyFavoriteMovie

Script for me to decide which one of all movies I've rated on IMDb is my top favorite.

The script fetches all movies in the table which are still unsorted, and takes two titles and let me decide between them. Next choice is between my previous preference and a new title.

My first usage of SQL and database handling in general.
